# Xplain-Meta-Primers
Governing framework for interpretable AI. Xplain Meta-Primer, primers, and romers, including enriched documentation (Markdown + Word/PDF), changelogs, and reviewer feedback. The Meta-Primer defines how primers are built, validated, and audited, ensuring structured trust and reducing variance in expert interpretation of AI outputs.

## Overview
The **Xplain Meta-Primer** is the constitutional framework for interpretable AI.  
It defines how **Primers** (domain-specific interpretive guides) and **Romers** (AI’s derived interpretive compasses) are constructed, validated, and audited.

##⚠️ Notice on Patent Status
The Xplain Meta-Primer framework is the subject of a provisional patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).

**Purpose**:  
- Address the **variance problem** — skilled experts interpreting identical AI outputs differently.  
- Build **structured trust** through transparent, reproducible frameworks.  
- Provide a foundation for adoption, scaling, and eventual standardization (ISO/IEEE alignment).

## Architecture
- **Meta-Primer** → Governs construction of all primers.  
- **Primer** → Domain-specific interpretive guide (e.g., GRC Data Quality Primer v3.0).  
- **Romer** → AI’s internal interpretive compass derived from a primer.  
- **Job** → Structured output (assessment, report, decision log) shaped by the Romer.

## Key Features
- **Human–AI Interaction Mandates**: confidence thresholds, boundary checks, materiality triggers.  
- **Analytics Selector**: AHP/ANP as default, with Bayesian, heuristic, calibrated ML, and NLP options.  
- **Self-Audit & Assurance**: built-in drift detection, back-testing, and quarterly assurance statements.  
- **Anti-Patterns Annex**: ossification, bias injection, overfitting, bureaucratisation.  
- **Implementation Playbook**: Quick Start (Bronze) → Pilot → Proof → Adoption → Scaling.  
- **Alignment with Standards**: ISO, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, GDPR.
