# Xplain-Meta-Primers
Governing framework for interpretable AI. Xplain Meta-Primer, primers, romers and AI direction statements, including enriched documentation (Markdown + Word/PDF), changelogs, and reviewer feedback. The Meta-Primer defines how primers are built, validated, and audited, ensuring structured trust and reducing variance in expert interpretation of AI outputs.

## Overview
The **Xplain Meta-Primer** is the constitutional framework for interpretable AI.  
It defines how **Primers** (domain-specific interpretive guides) and **Romers** (AI’s derived interpretive compasses) are constructed, validated, and audited.

##⚠️ Notice on Patent Status
The Xplain Meta-Primer framework is the subject of a provisional patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).

**Purpose**:  
- Address the **variance problem** — skilled experts interpreting identical AI outputs differently.  
- Build **structured trust** through transparent, reproducible frameworks.  
- Provide a foundation for adoption, scaling, and eventual standardization (ISO/IEEE alignment).
- Apply 'Side Knowledge' to utilise AI 'out of the box'.

## Architecture
- **Meta-Primer** → Governs construction of all primers.  
- **Primer** → Domain-specific interpretive guide (e.g., GRC Data Quality Primer v3.0).  
- **Romer** → AI’s internal interpretive compass derived from a primer.  
- **Job** → Structured output (assessment, report, decision log) shaped by the Romer.

## Key Features
- **Human–AI Interaction Mandates**: confidence thresholds, boundary checks, materiality triggers.  
- **Analytics Selector**: AHP/ANP as default, with Bayesian, heuristic, calibrated ML, and NLP options.  
- **Self-Audit & Assurance**: built-in drift detection, back-testing, and quarterly assurance statements.  
- **Anti-Patterns Annex**: ossification, bias injection, overfitting, bureaucratisation.  
- **Implementation Playbook**: Quick Start (Bronze) → Pilot → Proof → Adoption → Scaling.  
- **Alignment with Standards**: ISO, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, GDPR.

##🛠️ Evolution and Testing
The Xplain Meta-Primer has evolved through multiple iterations over 2 years (v0.1 → v0.3.1) based on structured reviewer feedback, convergence rounds with five independent expert readers, and integration of practical governance enhancements (human–AI interaction mandates, analytics selection, self-audit protocols, dual-readership approach).  Results have been submitted as formal papers for professional journal review.

It has been tested in applied contexts including governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) data quality assessment, demonstrating measurable reductions in expert interpretation variance. These early stage tests confirmed the framework’s ability to deliver improved structured trust and auditable reasoning.
